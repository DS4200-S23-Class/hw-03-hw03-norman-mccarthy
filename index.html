                    <h3> Marks </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Area: The data is shown with respect to specific 
                    states relative to spacing as well as showing the 
                    proportion of votes for each political party </li>
                <br>
                <li> Points: At the bottom it shows points representing the 
                    electoral votes for states that divide them accordingly </li>
            </ul> 
            <h3> Channels </h3>
            <ul>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Represents the party that won that state's electoral votes </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because it clearly differentiates
                        between the two parties and the states they won </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>

                <ul> 
                    <li> Represents where the state is in the country as a map </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because it accurately reflects where
                            the state is in respect to the rest of the country </li>
                </ul>

                <ul>
                    <li> Represents the party that won that state's electoral votes 
                        with Democrat as blue and Republican as red </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because people associate these colors
                         with these political parties historically </li>

                    <h3>Marks</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Points: point represents a batted ball</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Channels</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Color: Saturation and Hue</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Colors represent how above or below average the ball's scoring value is
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is a good color map. Pink represents a ball that has below-average scoring value, and orange represents above-average scoring value. Within each color, there are varying saturations to show how above or below average each ball is.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </ul>
        <h3>Colormap</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Divergent</li>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Colors represent how above or below average a ball's scoring value is, with white representing the average.
                </li>
                <li>
                    This is a good mapping as it shows which balls are below/above average and has a scale as to how below/above average each ball is.
                </li>
                <li>
                    It could also be argued that each side of the average is Sequential, as there is varying saturation depending on how far from the average the ball's scoring value is.

                    <ul>
                        <li>Each color represents the genre type of the movie, which is a categorical attribute.</li>
                        <li>This is a good color map because each genre is represented by its own color, with a legend to show what color each genre is associated with.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Position: Horizontal and Verical</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>The position of each point is determined by its critic rating and people (general watchers) rating, and represents quantative data as each rating is a number</li>
                        <li>This is a good mapping because you can see the critic scores and people scores in relation to each other, and easily compare how movies were received by different groups.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li>The color map is representing the categorical attribute of movie genres, with each movie genre having its own color
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is a good mapping because each genre has its own color that aren't chosen to be representing a range, and you can compare how movies of different genres were received.
