            <h3> Marks </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Area: The data is shown with respect to specific 
                    states relative to spacing as well as showing the 
                    proportion of votes for each political party </li>
                <br>
                <li> Points: At the bottom it shows points representing the 
                    electoral votes for states that divide them accordingly </li>
            </ul> 
            <h3> Channels </h3>
            <ul> 
                <li> Color: Hue </li>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Represents the party that won that state's electoral votes </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because it clearly differentiates
                        between the two parties and the states they won </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            <ul>
                <li> Position: Horizontal and Vertical </li>
                <ul> 
                    <li> Represents where the state is in the country as a map </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because it accurately reflects where
                            the state is in respect to the rest of the country </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
            </ul>
            <h3> Colormap </h3>
            <ul>
                <li> Categorical </li>
                <ul>
                    <li> Represents the party that won that state's electoral votes 
                        with Democrat as blue and Republican as red </li>
                    <li> This is a good mapping because people associate these colors
                         with these political parties historically </li>
                </ul>
            </ul>
